### time
you say the time by describing it, often using the word *tenpo*.

> ~ :preposition[in] :prep-phrase[the morning] \
> ~ :preposition[at] :prep-phrase[the time of the sun's arrival]

> ~ the person is working :prep-phrase[now]

> mi wawa mute lon :prep-phrase[tenpo pini] \
> ~ i was really confident in :prep-phrase[the past]

> mi wile ala pali lon :prep-phrase[tenpo lon] \
> ~ i don't want to work :prep-phrase[right now]

> waso li tawa sewi lon :prep-phrase[tenpo ale] \
> ~ birds :prep-phrase[always] fly \
> ~ birds fly at :prep-phrase[all times]

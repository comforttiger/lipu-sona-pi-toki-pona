### notes
:word[󱤓 jo] is not the same as english's general to have.

> 󱤴󱥷󱥉 \
> mi wile pali \
> ~ i have to work

> 󱤴󱥅󱤼󱤉󱥞 \
> mi olin mute e sina \
> ~ i have a lot of love for you

> 󱤴󱤶 \
> mi moku \
> ~ i have eaten

## lesson
there are two ways to ask yes/no questions, and one way to ask an open-ended one.

### 󱤌󱤂󱤌 ijo ala ijo
to ask yes or no questions, you use the :word[󱤌󱤂󱤌 ijo ala ijo] pattern, where :word[󱤌 ijo] is either the first word in the predicate, or the first preverb if there is one.

to answer a question like this you repeat the :word[󱤌 ijo] for yes, and say :word[󱤂 ala] or :word[󱤌󱤂 ijo ala] for no.

> 󱥆󱤧 :predicate[󱥦󱤂󱥦] 󱥩󱥞 \
> 󱥦 / 󱥦󱤂 \
> ona li :predicate[suwi ala suwi] tawa sina \
> suwi / suwi ala \
> ~ is she cute in your opinion? \
> ~ yes / no

> 󱥞 :preverb[󱥷󱤂󱥷] 󱥉 \
> 󱥷 / 󱤂 \
> sina :preverb[wile ala wile] pali \
> wile / ala \
> ~ do you want to work? \
> ~ yes / no

notice how easily recognizable the :word[󱤌󱤂󱤌 ijo ala ijo] pattern is, especially in sitelen pona.

### anu seme?
you can also form yes/no questions by appending :word[󱤇󱥙 anu seme] to the end. (don't worry, lesson 12 will cover the word :word[󱤇 anu])

they are answered the same way as :word[󱤌󱤂󱤌 ijo ala ijo] questions, by either repeating the :word[󱤌 ijo] which would be repeated, or :word[(󱤌)󱤂 (ijo) ala].

if you're unsure of which word to repeat, you could also just answer with a sentence.

> 󱥞󱤶󱤇󱥙 \
> 󱤴󱤶 / 󱤶 / 󱤶󱤂 \
> sina moku anu seme \
> mi moku / moku / moku ala \
> ~ do you eat? \
> ~ i do eat / yes / no

> 󱥁󱤧󱤎󱤕󱥞󱤇󱥙 \
> 󱥁󱤧󱤎󱤕󱤴 / 󱤎 / 󱤂 \
> ni li ilo kalama sina anu seme \
> ni li ilo kalama mi / ilo / ala \
> ~ is this your instrument? \
> ~ this is my instrument / yes / no

### open-ended questions
open-ended questions are formed by making a normal sentence and putting the word :word[󱥙 seme] where the missing information would go.

if you have phrased the question correctly, the responder should be able to replace the word :word[󱥙 seme] with the answer.

> 󱥞 :predicate[󱥙] \
> 󱤴 :predicate[󱥈󱤉󱤌] / 󱤴 :predicate[󱥢󱦐󱥧󱤉󱥦󱤈󱦑] \
> sina :predicate[seme] \
> mi :predicate[pakala e ijo] / mi :predicate[soweli Tesa] \
> ~ what are you doing / who are you? \
> ~ i'm breaking stuff / i'm tess

> :subject[󱥙] 󱤧󱤬󱥥 \
> :subject[󱤲󱤄󱤴] (󱤧󱤬󱥥) \
> :subject[seme] li lon supa \
> :subject[mani ale mi] (li lon supa) \
> ~ what's on the table? \
> ~ all of my money (is on the table)

> 󱥢󱦐󱥦󱤌󱤑󱤄󱤧󱤂󱦑󱤧󱤬 :prep-phrase[󱥙] \
> 󱥆󱤧󱤬 :prep-phrase[󱤏󱥍󱦗󱥓󱤔󱦘]󱤀 \
> soweli Sijala li lon :prep-phrase[seme] \
> ona li lon :prep-phrase[insa pi poki kala] a \
> ~ where is tiara? \
> ~ she is inside the container of fish!

## lesson
### the particle 󱥍pi
:word[󱥍 pi] is a really useful particle that regroups modifiers.

normally, each modifier modifies the sum of all the previous words in the phrase. the particle :word[󱥍 pi] creates a second phrase which modifies the first phrase.

> :subject[󱤌] :predicate[󱥔] :direct-object[󱤼] \
> :subject[ijo] :predicate[pona] :direct-object[mute] \
> ~ :direct-object[many] :predicate[good] :subject[things]

> :subject[󱤌] 󱥍 :subject[󱥔] :predicate[󱤼] \
> :subject[ijo] pi :subject[pona] :predicate[mute] \
> ~ :predicate[very] :subject[good] :subject[thing]

in the first example, :word[󱤼 mute] modifies :word[󱤌󱥔 ijo pona], while in the second example, :word[󱥔󱤼 pona mute] modifies :word[󱤌 ijo].

in sitelen pona, some also write pi phrases like this, with 󱥍 extending underneath the phrase:

> 󱤌󱥍󱦗󱥔󱤼󱦘 \
> ~ ijo pi pona mute

### definition of phrase
phrase refers to a collection of a main word + modifiers, like :word[󱤑 jan] or :word[󱤎󱤶 ilo moku].

### note about long phrases
it's a common mistake to try to cram as much information as possible into just one phrase. try to avoid this!

if you want to be more easily understood, it's often better to describe concepts in sentences, and then refer back to previously described concepts with a concise phrase which makes sense within the context you've established.

### examples
> 󱤴󱥬󱤉 :subject[󱤌] 󱥍 :subject[󱥔] :predicate[󱤼] \
> mi toki e :subject[ijo] pi :subject[pona] :predicate[mute] \
> ~ i talk about a :predicate[very] :subject[good] :subject[thing]

> 󱤴󱥬󱤉 :subject[󱤌] :predicate[󱥔] :direct-object[󱤼] \
> mi toki e :subject[ijo] :predicate[pona] :direct-object[mute] \
> ~ i talk about :direct-object[many] :predicate[good] :subject[things]

> 󱤴󱥬󱤉 :subject[󱤌] :predicate[󱤼] 󱥍 :subject[󱥔] :predicate[󱤼] \
> mi toki e :subject[ijo] :predicate[mute] pi :subject[pona] :predicate[mute] \
> ~ i talk about :predicate[many] :subject[things] which are :predicate[very] :subject[good]

## lesson
### main counting system
toki pona has five words to describe amounts: *ala*, *wan*, *tu*, *mute*, *ale*,
meaning *nothing*, *one*, *two*, *many*, *everything*.

other number systems exist, but this one will usually be all you need.

often specific numbers end up obscuring what a quantity really means, because large numbers are a lot harder to conceptualize than a description of what this quantity really means.

> they have *28* cars! \
> ona li jo e tomo tawa mute a

### ordinal numbers
you can use the particle *nanpa* before a number to express an ordinal number.

> soweli nanpa tu \
> ~ the second animal

### a more advanced counting system
be aware that this counting system isn't intended to be used very much. in most cases, vague amounts will also get the message across.

this counting system uses 5 words:

󱥳 wan - one \
󱥮 tu - two \
󱤭 luka - five \
󱤼 mute - twenty \
󱤄 ale - one hundred

this system is additive, meaning you chain together the words to create bigger numbers

> luka luka tu \
> ~ five + five + two \
> = 12

> ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale ale mute tu \
> ~ 2022

as you can see, it's still not very convenient for big numbers - this is by design!

## contributing to an incomplete translation
these languages have had translations begun, but the translator who initially started hasn't had the time to complete their translation. if you'd like to help make a translation complete, download its zip file, which contains all the markdown files that make up each translation. when you're done or if you need any help, send me a message on [discord](https://discord.com/users/152843864342790145) or [e-mail](mailto:tiger@comforttiger.space)!

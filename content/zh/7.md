## lesson
### prepositions
*lon*, *tawa*, *tan*, *sama*, and *kepeken* are :preposition[prepositions].

prepositions are used to express specific details about the predicate, like how or where. just like preverbs, prepositions can be negated by the word *ala*. the preposition is appended to the end of the sentence, followed by a :prep-phrase[phrase].

> :subject[subject] li ( :predicate[predicate] e :direct-object[object]) :preposition[preposition] :prep-phrase[phrase]

> mi pali :preposition[lon] :prep-phrase[tomo moku] \
> ~ i work :preposition[at] :prep-phrase[a restaurant]

the preposition can also be the predicate:

> ona li :preposition[lon] :prep-phrase[tomo mi] \
> ~ they are :preposition[at] :prep-phrase[my house]

prepositions can also be used as regular words:

> tawa sina li musi \
> ~ your movements are amusing

### examples
> mani mute li :preposition[lon] :prep-phrase[tomo mani] \
> ~ there's lots of money at the bank

> jan li :preposition[tawa] :prep-phrase[tomo sina] \
> ~ a person goes to your house

> mi pali e ijo mute :preposition[kepeken] :prep-phrase[ilo] \
> ~ i make lots of things :preposition[with] :prep-phrase[tools]

> mi toki e pona sina :preposition[tan] :prep-phrase[ni · mi olin e sina] \

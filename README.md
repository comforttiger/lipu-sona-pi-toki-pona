## contributing translations
to contribute a new translation, fork this repo, and make a new folder for your translation in the `content/` directory. name it the language code of the language you're translating to. copy the contents of `en/` as a starting point, and then just start translating! when you're done, make a pull request and i'll take a look at it :)

### building
if you want to look at your translation on the site before making the pull request:

1. install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. take a look!
